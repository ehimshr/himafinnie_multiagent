Agenda : AI Finance Assistant addresses the gap by providing personalized, accessible financial education and guidance through an intelligent multi-agent conversational system

Technical Architecture
The AI Finance Assistant employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture built on modern AI frameworks:
Multi-Agent System: LangChain and LangGraph
Language Model: Open AI GPT
Vector Database: Chroma DB
Market Data: yFinance API
Web Interface: Streamlit
State Management: LangGraph

The Power of Multi-Agent LLMs should be:
● Specialized Expertise: Each agent focuses on specific domains (portfolio analysis, market trends, tax education), ensuring deep, accurate responses in each area.
● Context Preservation: The system maintains conversation history and user profiles, enabling progressively sophisticated guidance as users learn.
● RAG Enhancement: Retrieval-augmented generation ensures responses are grounded in verified financial knowledge while remaining conversational


Agent Architecture should be:
The system consists of six specialized agents:
1. Finance Q&A Agent: 
   - Handles general financial education queries
   - RAG should be grounded to
